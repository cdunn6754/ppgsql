# ppgSQL
A toy database, hopefully MVCC and taking a lot of inspiration from postgres
if it ever becomes sophisiticated enough to matter which real database
it is styled after.

Its primary purpose is to help me refresh some cpp skills using at least C++11 techniques.


To build and run with CMake 3.10:

```
$ cd build
$ cmake
...
$ make
...
$ ./ppgsql.exe
```
